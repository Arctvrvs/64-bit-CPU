# lsu Module

The `lsu.sv` file provides a simple two-port load/store unit used in early
pipeline simulations. It accepts up to two memory operations each cycle and
forwards them to the L1 data cache.

## Behavior

For each valid operation the LSU now translates the virtual address through a
two-level TLB hierarchy implemented by `tlb_l1_64e_8w` and `tlb_l2_512e_8w`.
If neither TLB contains the mapping a request is sent to `page_walker8` and the
Âµop stalls until the walk completes. Translation faults are reported to the
caller. After a successful translation the unit issues a request to the data
cache. Loads return their data one cycle later assuming the cache responds
ready. Stores simply forward their data and do not produce a result. This
behavioral model still omits ordering rules but now mirrors the basic MMU
interaction expected in the RTL.

A lightweight Python `LSU` model mirrors this behavior for unit tests. It
uses the `DataMemoryModel` helper to service load and store operations.
When provided a `CoverageModel` instance the LSU records TLB hit/miss
statistics, lookup latency and permission faults. Page walks issued to its
`PageWalker8` helper are logged as well along with any resulting faults.
