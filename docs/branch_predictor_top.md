# branch_predictor_top Module

`branch_predictor_top.sv` integrates several prediction structures: a return
stack buffer (RSB), a branch target buffer (BTB) with 2â€‘bit saturating
counters, a small TAGE predictor and an indirect branch predictor. The module
selects the next PC based on decode information and updates predictor state when
branches retire.

| `is_indirect_retire_i` | in | 1 | Retiring instruction was indirect |

## Behavior

The predictor chooses the next PC using the following priority:

1. If `is_ret_i` is asserted, the return stack buffer provides the predicted
   address.
2. Else if `is_uncond_branch_i` is set, the BTB supplies the target address.
3. Else if `is_cond_branch_i` is set, the TAGE predictor decides whether the
   branch is taken. If taken, the BTB target is used.
4. Else if `is_indirect_i` is set, the indirect branch predictor returns the
   predicted target address.
5. Otherwise the next sequential PC (`pc_id_i + 4`) is chosen.

On branch retirement the BTB, TAGE and IBP tables are updated with the actual
outcome and target. Calls push the return address onto the RSB and returns pop
it.
