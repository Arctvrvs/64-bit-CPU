# rob256 Module

The `rob256.sv` module implements a simplified reorder buffer for the early
OOO pipeline stages. It can allocate up to eight new entries per cycle and
tracks completion via a writeback interface. Entries commit in program order
when ready.

## I/O Ports

| Name | Dir | Width | Description |
|------|-----|-------|-------------|
| `clk` | in | 1 | Clock |
| `rst_n` | in | 1 | Active-low reset |
| `alloc_valid_i[7:0]` | in | 1 each | Allocate new ROB entry |
| `dest_phys_i[7:0]` | in | 7 each | Destination physical register |
| `old_dest_phys_i[7:0]` | in | 7 each | Previous mapping |
| `is_store_i[7:0]` | in | 1 each | Marks store operations |
| `is_branch_i[7:0]` | in | 1 each | Marks branch operations |
| `alloc_ready_o` | out | 1 | Indicates space for eight entries |
| `alloc_idx_o[7:0]` | out | 8 each | Index assigned to new entry |
| `wb_valid_i[7:0]` | in | 1 each | Writeback for completed Âµops |
| `wb_idx_i[7:0]` | in | 8 each | Index of completing entry |
| `commit_ready_i` | in | 1 | Allows commit this cycle |
| `commit_valid_o` | out | 1 | A commit occurred |
| `commit_idx_o[7:0]` | out | 8 | Index of committing entry |
| `commit_rd_phys_o[6:0]` | out | 7 | Destination register |
| `commit_old_phys_o[6:0]` | out | 7 | Previous mapping to free |
| `commit_is_store_o` | out | 1 | Committed instruction was a store |
| `commit_branch_misp_o` | out | 1 | Placeholder branch mispredict flag |

## Behavior

A circular array of 256 entries tracks all in-flight operations. When space is
available (`alloc_ready_o`), up to eight new entries are added each cycle at the
tail pointer. The writeback interface marks entries ready for commit. When the
oldest valid entry is ready and `commit_ready_i` is asserted, that entry's
information is presented on the commit outputs and the head pointer advances.
This module is a behavioral placeholder; exception handling and branch
checkpointing are left for later development.
